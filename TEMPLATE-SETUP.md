# Template setup

This repository is a scaffold. Work through this file to turn it into your own project. Then
delete it together with the two notes that point here from [`README.md`](README.md), its row in
the README's Project Layout block, and
[`scripts/test-template-setup.sh`](scripts/test-template-setup.sh) with its `run` line in
[`scripts/check-all.sh`](scripts/check-all.sh) and its step in the `docs` job of
[`checks.yml`](.github/workflows/checks.yml).

## What only you can do

1. Give the project its identity. An agent asks the human for four values and applies them:
   - **Project name.** Replace **NUC** in the title of [`README.md`](README.md) and in `"name"`
     of `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, and rewrite the README's intro sentence, which explains
     the template's name. Keep `NUC maintainer` in the `Deciders` lines of the ADRs: it names who
     decided, and it is how check 12 of [`scripts/check-docs.sh`](scripts/check-docs.sh) tells an
     inherited ADR from your own.
   - **Repository.** The badge in [`README.md`](README.md) points at the template's repository,
     `hivevm/nuc`. Repoint it to this project's `owner/name` (`git remote get-url origin` says it
     where a remote exists), or delete the badge line.
   - **Maintainer.** The copyright holder in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE), the code owner in
     [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS) (a GitHub handle or team with write access; then
     uncomment its two rules and remove the TODO above them), the security contact in
     [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md), and the reporting contact in
     [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
   - **License.** MIT ships in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) and in the **License** section of the README.
     For another license, replace the text of both.
   Check 13 of [`scripts/check-docs.sh`](scripts/check-docs.sh) fails on any of these placeholders
   still present once this file is gone.
2. Review the ADRs you inherit in [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/). Each was decided by the NUC
   maintainer, not by you, and binds this project only once you accept it as your own decision:
   add yourself to its `Deciders`, with its `Status` at `🟢 accepted` in the index and the file,
   or supersede it with an ADR of your own ([`AGENTS.md` §3](AGENTS.md#3-adr-rules)). Nothing in
   between: an inherited ADR nobody here has accepted is a rule nobody decided, and check 12 of
   [`scripts/check-docs.sh`](scripts/check-docs.sh) fails on one in force without a decider of
   this project once this file is gone. The template ships each with its test or its
   exemption, so the checks stay green. The shape of the code is not among them: it is a
   founding decision of step 4.
3. Write down the **project idea** in [`docs/SPECIFICATION.md`](docs/SPECIFICATION.md), and
   give it and the other three documents of [`docs/`](docs/) the project's name in their title.
   Each section of the scaffold says in a line what belongs in it. Write the **Problem** first;
   everything else rests on it. The goals, the quality goals, and the threats are what the
   founding decisions of step 4 are weighed against, so they come before them. The `<Part>`,
   `<Term>`, and `<Convention>` entries of the other three show the form of an entry: replace
   each with a real one, or delete it while there is nothing to say. Check 13 fails on a
   `<Project Name>` title, a placeholder criterion, or a scaffold entry still present once this
   file is gone.
4. Take the **founding decisions**: the few that every later session works inside and that are
   expensive to discover by accident. Each brings its **guides**, which steer an agent before it
   acts, and its **sensors**, which check what it did. Committing to them early narrows what an
   agent can produce to what the sensors can hold
   ([harness engineering](https://martinfowler.com/articles/harness-engineering.html)).
   For each, the agent proposes the fitting concepts of the catalogue in
   [`.agents/skills/propose-adr/concepts/`](.agents/skills/propose-adr/concepts/README.md), the
   simplest among them, with what each one's *Does not fit* says about this project; you choose,
   and the choice becomes an ADR of your own ([`AGENTS.md` §3](AGENTS.md#3-adr-rules), rule 1).
   One decision per ADR, all of them in one pull request of ADRs, status `proposed`
   ([`AGENTS.md` §3](AGENTS.md#3-adr-rules), rule 3). Keeping what the template ships is a
   choice too, and gets the mini-ADR of [`docs/adr/template.md`](docs/adr/template.md): this
   file goes once the setup is done, and without the record the next session proposes the
   question again. Decide these and no more; everything else is decided when the work first
   needs it.
   - **The harness** ([catalogue](.agents/skills/propose-adr/concepts/harness.md)): which agents
     and models work here, who reviews what, and what may run unattended.
   - **The toolchain** ([catalogue](.agents/skills/propose-adr/concepts/toolchain.md)): the
     language, its build, test, and lint commands, and its sensors in three kinds.
   - **The shape of the code,** from the catalogue's group of that name, with the rule a
     structural test decides, or no prescribed shape, as the template ships. A decision about
     the shape is the one entropy erodes first.
   - **The environment:** the base of the Dev Container (an image, a `Dockerfile`, or Compose)
     and how the work reaches the containers it needs, or none, as `.devcontainer/` ships it.
   - **The supply chain:** how the workflows reference actions, by major version tag as the
     template ships them, and, where the specification names credentials as an asset, where
     secrets live and how a leak is caught.

   These ADRs are a start, not a cage. While they are `proposed`, a finding revises one in an
   ADR-only pull request ([`AGENTS.md` §3](AGENTS.md#3-adr-rules), rule 4), and the ones the
   golden path of step 7 proves wrong are rewritten before they bind. Each flips to accepted with
   what decides it: the shape and the toolchain with the golden path and its tests, the
   environment with `scripts/check-devcontainer.sh` and what its ADR adds, the supply chain with
   [`scripts/sensor-action-refs.sh`](scripts/sensor-action-refs.sh) run as its check, wired as
   its [catalogue entry](.agents/skills/propose-adr/concepts/action-references.md) says. The
   harness and a kept default usually flip with a `**Not mechanically decidable:**` paragraph.
   After that, following the technology means superseding the one ADR that chose it.
5. Fill in the **Overview**, **Build, Test & Run**, and **Usage** sections of
   [`README.md`](README.md). Check 13 fails on the scaffold's Overview sentence, the Usage
   `TODO`, and a Build, Test, Lint, or Run command still `TODO` once this file is gone; write
   "none" where there is nothing to run.
6. Add the toolchain of step 4 to the environment (the base image ships none). The build, test,
   and lint commands of the README run through **one script under [`scripts/`](scripts/)**, say
   `check-build.sh`. [`scripts/check-all.sh`](scripts/check-all.sh) invokes it with a `run` line,
   and a job of [`checks.yml`](.github/workflows/checks.yml) runs it after setting up the
   toolchain, the job named among the required checks in the README. That is what makes the
   pre-push hook and CI refuse a red change
   ([`AGENTS.md` §5](AGENTS.md#5-quality-bar--definition-of-done)). Check 9 of
   [`scripts/check-docs.sh`](scripts/check-docs.sh) fails on a job whose commands are written
   inline instead, and while the three lists disagree. What is too slow to gate a push, such as
   a nightly suite or a long benchmark, is a workflow of its own on a schedule, not a job here.
   The sensors the toolchain ADR names run the same way; their output is what the reviewer of
   [`AGENTS.md` §5](AGENTS.md#5-quality-bar--definition-of-done) is handed, and a sensor that
   runs only in someone's head is a rule in prose.
7. Lay down one golden path and one test pattern: a small, complete, idiomatic piece of the real
   system and the test that verifies it, built on the founding decisions. Name both in
   [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). The specification says *what*; this is where
   an agent learns *how* this project does it, and what it copies from is what you get more of.
   Where the project chose a shape, its rule lands here as a **structural test**, cited with a
   `Verifies:` marker ([ADR-0003](docs/adr/0003-decisions-verified-by-tests.md)), and the shape
   ADR flips to accepted with it; the toolchain ADR flips with the golden path's tests. What the
   golden path shows that no check decides and a reader could not guess, the why behind a shape,
   is the first entry in [`docs/CONVENTIONS.md`](docs/CONVENTIONS.md).
8. Work through [**Repository settings**](README.md#repository-settings), the rules that only the
   GitHub repository itself can enforce.

Project-specific conventions belong in [`docs/CONVENTIONS.md`](docs/CONVENTIONS.md), in checks,
and in ADRs; on what may and may not be edited, see [`AGENTS.md` §3](AGENTS.md#3-adr-rules).
Leave the **Dev Container**, **Coding Agents**, **Repository settings**, **Template**, and
**Project Layout** sections of the README as-is; they describe the scaffold. A project without a
Dev Container changes the first two as [A small project](#a-small-project) says. The Template
section names the release this project was created from and is the one link to the template
that stays. The Project Layout block only inventories the files, so a document you remove goes
out of it too, this file included.

## A small project

A tool, a library, or a one-person project pays for the steps above only where they buy
something. The chain stays intact as long as three inherited ADRs stand: ADR-0001 (the
documents the checks read), ADR-0003 (a `Verifies:` marker per accepted decision, one line of
cost), and ADR-0005 (the skills and their pointers, which cost nothing until invoked).
[ADR-0006](docs/adr/0006-template-releases.md) costs nothing to accept: it is one line of the
README. What can go, and how:

- **No Dev Container?** Supersede [ADR-0002](docs/adr/0002-dev-container-runtime.md) with an ADR
  that says where the work runs instead, and remove what the container brings in the same change:
  - `.devcontainer/`, and the check that holds ADR-0002: `scripts/check-devcontainer.sh` and its
    self-test, which cites the superseded ADR;
  - the `devcontainer` job and its bullet in the header of
    [`checks.yml`](.github/workflows/checks.yml), its `run` lines in
    [`scripts/check-all.sh`](scripts/check-all.sh), and its name in the README's required checks;
    check 9 holds the three lists together;
  - the `remote.extensionKind` entry of [`.vscode/settings.json`](.vscode/settings.json) and the
    lock comment of [`.gitignore`](.gitignore);
  - in the README, the Dev Container section and the `.devcontainer/` row of the Project Layout,
    with Prerequisites, Getting Started, and the first paragraph of Coding Agents rewritten for
    the host; the first bullet of Agent execution in [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md); and the Dev
    Container in the workflow of [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

  The link, layout, list, and traceability checks fail on a file, a job, or a link left behind;
  the prose is the reviewer's to read. This file names what the path removes without linking it,
  so its own links hold while the path is walked.
- **No shape worth a decision?** A script or a thin CLI keeps what the template ships, no
  prescribed shape, in a mini-ADR that says so.
- **Work never exceeds a session?** [ADR-0004](docs/adr/0004-feature-layer.md) stays accepted and
  costs nothing: it applies only above that threshold, and the threshold is a judgement under
  proportionality ([`AGENTS.md` §1](AGENTS.md#1-principles)).
- **The harness and the toolchain** take the smallest form of their catalogue entries: one agent
  and the human reviewing every change, the linter's own rules as the first sensors. Each grows
  when the work does.
- **A single maintainer** cannot approve their own pull request, so the Code Owners review in
  the repository settings cannot be met; keep the required checks and the force-push block, and
  let [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS) name the owner without the requirement. The
  status flip and the specification are then guarded by the rule alone; say so where
  [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) describes the gate.

[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md), the glossary, the conventions, and the overview stay, empty where
there is nothing to say; a scaffold section costs a reader a glance, a missing document costs a
check.
