# Shell lint for this repository.
#
# Runs ShellCheck over every shell script of the repository: every '*.sh' file git does not
# ignore, and the git hooks under .githooks/, which git requires to be named without an extension.
# The files come from git, as in every other check, so a script under .scratch/ or under a build
# directory the project ignores is no part of the gate. The scripts under scripts/ and the hooks
# are the repository's entire enforcement layer, so they are held to a lint gate themselves.
#
# ShellCheck is the one check dependency beyond bash + coreutils/git. CI does not install it — the
# GitHub-hosted runner image ships it preinstalled, and the Dev Container installs it on creation
# (.devcontainer/devcontainer.json). Elsewhere, when shellcheck is not on PATH, the
# check skips itself with a notice instead of failing (CI remains the enforcing gate); in a CI
# run (CI=true) a missing shellcheck is an error, never a silent skip.
#
# Beyond ShellCheck it refuses GNU sed's in-place flag, `sed -i`, which BSD sed on macOS reads as
# taking a suffix: check-all.sh, and with it the pre-push hook, runs on any host. Comment lines are
# not read. The rule reads the options right after `sed`, so it misses a flag after a script
# (`sed -e S -i f`), and it reads text, so it flags the words inside a quoted string or after a
# trailing comment; spell those differently.
#
# Usage:
#     scripts/check-shell.sh [repository root]        (or: bash scripts/check-shell.sh)
# The root defaults to this repository; scripts/test-check-shell.sh passes fixtures.
# Exit code 0 when all scripts pass (ShellCheck skipped when unavailable outside CI), 1 otherwise,
# 2 on a root that is no directory.
