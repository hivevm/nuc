# Shell lint for this template.
#
# Runs ShellCheck over every shell script in the repository. The scripts under scripts/ are the
# template's entire enforcement layer, so they are held to a lint gate themselves.
#
# ShellCheck is the one check dependency beyond bash + coreutils. CI does not install it — the
# GitHub-hosted runner image ships it preinstalled. Locally, when shellcheck is not on PATH, the
# check skips itself with a notice instead of failing (CI remains the enforcing gate); in a CI
# run (CI=true) a missing shellcheck is an error, never a silent skip.
#
# Usage:
#     scripts/check-shell.sh        (or: bash scripts/check-shell.sh)
# Exit code 0 when all scripts pass (or shellcheck is unavailable outside CI), 1 otherwise.
