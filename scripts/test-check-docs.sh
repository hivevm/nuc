# Self-test of scripts/check-docs.sh. Verifies: ADR-0001 ADR-0003
#
# Each case builds a throwaway git repository under a temporary directory — a rule file with
# numbered sections, a README with the Template release line, a CONTRIBUTING.md with a Project
# Layout block and the required-checks markers, a workflow and a local runner listing the same
# check, an ADR record with its index, and one skill with its pointer — runs the check against it,
# and asserts the exit code and, for a failing case, the message that names the violation. The
# baseline passes; every other case breaks one thing. The skill pointer check (check 11 of
# check-docs.sh) is covered in every direction; of the older checks, one case each pins the message
# a maintainer would meet first — check 9 gets two more for the toolchain job a derived project
# adds, check 13 (the setup done) has a case for each placeholder, and check 14 (the template
# release named) one for each form the line may take. The cases of the record checks, 1, 2, 5, 6,
# 8, 12, and the roles of 13, stand in the fixture table scripts/fixtures/check-docs-record.txt,
# which says its format. Every fixture has its setup done, so it carries an accepted ADR for each
# required role.
#
# Section references and ADR identifiers inside fixtures are assembled, never written literally,
# so that check-docs.sh does not read this script's own fixtures as references into this
# repository.
#
# Inputs: scripts/check-docs.sh scripts/lib/ scripts/fixtures/
#
# Usage:
#     scripts/test-check-docs.sh
# Exit code 0 when every case passes, 1 otherwise.
