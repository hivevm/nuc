# Self-test of scripts/check-shell.sh.
#
# Each case builds a throwaway git repository with one shell script that ShellCheck flags, runs
# the lint against it, and asserts the exit code: a tracked script and a new one git does not
# ignore fail, a script under an ignored directory and a git hook in .githooks/ are read as git
# lists them, and a directory that is no repository fails rather than passing empty. GNU sed's
# in-place flag fails and names the line, while a temporary file and a comment pass. Where
# ShellCheck is not on PATH the lint skips ShellCheck, and so does this test with the cases that
# need it.
#
# Usage:
#     scripts/test-check-shell.sh
# Exit code 0 when every case passes, 1 otherwise.
