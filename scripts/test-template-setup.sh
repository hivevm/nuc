# Self-test of the template setup (TEMPLATE-SETUP.md) against this repository's own files.
#
# The setup promises two things the fixture tests of the single checks cannot see, because they
# hold only on the real scaffold: that check 12 and check 13 of scripts/check-docs.sh name every
# placeholder the setup leaves behind once its file is gone, and that a project which has done
# every step is green. Each case copies the repository's files into a throwaway git repository
# and runs the checks against the copy:
#
#   1. Setup file deleted, nothing else done: check-docs.sh names each placeholder of steps 1,
#      2, 3, and 5 that is still in the tree, and the README's notes that point at the setup
#      file while they are there. Every file that carries a token of a placeholder (TOKENS) is
#      named in its output, so a placeholder added to a file no row knows of fails here.
#   2. The remaining steps done, as an agent would do them from the steps' wording: no token is
#      left, and check-docs.sh, check-traceability.sh, and check-devcontainer.sh pass.
#   3. The same, on the path 'No Dev Container?' of 'A small project': ADR-0002 superseded and
#      what the container brings removed as the path lists it. check-docs.sh and
#      check-traceability.sh pass. It runs while the path is open, before a project has begun it.
#
# A project partway through the setup has replaced some placeholders already. Case 1 asks only
# for those still present, and an edit of case 2 that finds nothing to change does nothing, so
# the test holds at every point of the setup. A placeholder the scaffold rewords so that an edit
# no longer applies stays in the copy, and case 2 fails on it.
#
# The setup file goes together with this script, its 'run' line in scripts/check-all.sh, and its
# step in the docs job. Should the script outlive the file, it says there is nothing left to
# test and passes.
#
# Pure bash + coreutils/sed/tar, plus git to enumerate the files and build the copy. Usage:
#     scripts/test-template-setup.sh
# Exit code 0 when every case passes, 1 otherwise.

- **Date:** 2026-01-01
- **Deciders:** Fixture Owner
- **Applies to:** the development environment
- **Supersedes:** [ADR-0002](0002-dev-container-runtime.md)

## Context

The project is a small tool, and its one maintainer works on the host.

## Decision

We will work on the host, without a Dev Container.

**Out of scope:** nothing beyond the sentence above.

## Alternatives considered

None — cheap to reverse.

## Sources / Prior art

None — cheap to reverse.

## Consequences

None — cheap to reverse.

## Enforcement

**Not mechanically decidable:** where a maintainer works is outside the tree.
