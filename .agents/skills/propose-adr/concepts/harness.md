# Harness

Which agents and models work in the project, the permission mode they run under, who reviews
what, and what may run unattended. Every project decides it at setup, because every later session
works inside it. Its **guides** steer an agent before it acts: the rule file, the skills, the
golden path. Its **sensors** check what the agent did: the computational ones, tests and checks
that are deterministic and cheap enough to run on every change, and the inferential one, the
review in a fresh context. The harness ADR is the one
[`AGENTS.md` §4](../../../../AGENTS.md#4-working-style) names for the parts kept with the human
and the cap on open agent work.

## Signals

- A new project takes its founding decisions.
- A second agent, a second human, or parallel sessions start working in the repository.
- A ticket asks to run unattended, and nothing says what may.
- Reviews pile up faster than the humans read them.

## Fits when

- **One agent, the human reviews every change**: one agent and model; the human reads every pull
  request; nothing runs unattended; no parallel sessions; a mini-ADR. A tool, a library, or a
  one-person project starts here and grows the harness when the work does.
- **Implementer and reviewer apart**: one agent and model implements, another reviews in a fresh
  context, a stronger model where one exists; the parts the specification's *Threats & Forbidden
  Actions* protects get a second reviewer of a different kind and the human who owns the part.
- **Unattended tickets under a cap**: tickets whose *Mode* allows it run without the human
  ([ADR-0006](../../../../docs/adr/0006-feature-layer.md)); parallel sessions are kept apart by a
  worktree or a container each; an unattended session claims a ticket from the frontier by
  assigning itself; and the open agent work is capped at what the humans can review.

Whichever fits, the ADR answers: which agent and model implements and which reviews; how parallel
sessions are kept apart, if there are any; how much agent work may be open at once; and which
parts of the system are never worked unattended however small the ticket, such as
authentication and authorization, payment, public interfaces, data migrations, and whatever else
the specification's threats protect.

## Does not fit

- Unattended work without a cap: with agents the bottleneck moves from writing to reviewing, and
  a harness that outruns the review produces a backlog, not software.
- The implementer reviewing its own change:
  [`AGENTS.md` §5](../../../../AGENTS.md#5-quality-bar--definition-of-done) excludes it whatever
  the harness says.
- A gate in one agent's own configuration as the enforcement of a rule: the next agent does not
  honour it, so it looks like a rule and is not one.

## The rule a test decides

None, as a rule: who reviews and what runs unattended is decided outside the tree. The ADR says
so in a `**Not mechanically decidable:**` paragraph
([ADR-0002](../../../../docs/adr/0002-decisions-verified-by-tests.md)). What the harness relies on
mechanically is already checked: the git hooks, the required checks, and the Code Owners review
of the repository settings.

## Sensors

The review skill, the inferential sensor; the git hooks under `.githooks/`; the required checks
and the Code Owners review listed under *Repository settings* in the README.

## Alternatives

The three forms above grow into each other. A process-owning framework that brings agents,
artifacts, and pipeline in one piece is a fourth; ADR-0003 and ADR-0006 decline it for the
template.
