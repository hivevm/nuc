# NUC — an Agentic, Specification-Oriented Starter Template

[![Checks](https://github.com/hivevm/nuc/actions/workflows/checks.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hivevm/nuc/actions/workflows/checks.yml)

**NUC** is named after the small *nucleus colony* a full hive grows from in beekeeping. It is a
starting point for building
software **with coding agents** inside a ready-to-use Dev Container. The work is driven by a
written **specification** ([`docs/SPECIFICATION.md`](docs/SPECIFICATION.md)) and **Architecture
Decision Records** ([`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/)), so intent and the reasoning behind every structural
choice stay explicit and reviewable.

> For agent instructions, see [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md), the single source of truth for all coding agents.

> [!NOTE]
> **This project still carries its template setup.** The one-time steps that turn the scaffold
> into your own project are in [`TEMPLATE-SETUP.md`](TEMPLATE-SETUP.md). Delete that file and this
> note once you are through them.

## Overview

Describe what this project does, who it is for, and its main goals. The full problem statement and
goals live in [`docs/SPECIFICATION.md`](docs/SPECIFICATION.md), the vocabulary in
[`docs/GLOSSARY.md`](docs/GLOSSARY.md).

## Prerequisites

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the
  [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
  extension, or any DevContainer-compatible IDE
- Docker / Podman (rootless) available on the host

## Getting Started

> Setting the project up for the first time? The one-time steps are in
> [`TEMPLATE-SETUP.md`](TEMPLATE-SETUP.md). Delete this paragraph together with that file.

1. Open the repository in VS Code and choose **Reopen in Container**. The Dev Container and the
   preconfigured agent extensions build automatically, and the container enables the repository's
   git hooks ([`.githooks/`](.githooks/)): no commit on `main`, and the checks run before a push.
   Working outside the container? Enable them yourself, once per clone:
   `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.
2. Authenticate your coding agent inside the container (for Claude Code: `claude login`).
3. Start working with the agent. Drive the work from the specification and the ADRs.

## Build, Test & Run

<!-- Fill in once the toolchain is chosen. This section is the single source for build/test/run
     commands; both humans and agents rely on it (AGENTS.md links here). -->

- **Build:** TODO <!-- e.g. `make build` -->
- **Test:** TODO <!-- e.g. `make test` -->
- **Run:** TODO <!-- e.g. `make run` -->

## Usage

<!-- Once there is something to use, show how to use the built software: the primary commands or
     API, a minimal example, and the expected output. Keep build/test/run mechanics in the section
     above; this section is about using the result, not producing it. -->

TODO — show a minimal example of using the project.

## Dev Container

The environment is defined entirely in
[`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json). It starts from a prebuilt
base image and layers Dev Container Features and VS Code extensions on top; no Dockerfile or
Compose file is required. Customise the environment by adding Features, switching the base image,
or adding extensions. Features are pinned by major tag and resolved in the committed
`devcontainer-lock.json`. Extensions are listed by identifier only, because a published extension
version cannot be repointed and a version suffix is VS Code-specific.

### Host container management

The Dev Container deliberately has **no access to the host Docker daemon**: the socket is not
mounted ([ADR-0002](docs/adr/0002-dev-container-runtime.md)). To manage the host's containers from
VS Code, run the **Container Tools** extension (`ms-azuretools.vscode-containers`) on the **host**
side: install it in your host VS Code. [`.vscode/settings.json`](.vscode/settings.json) already pins
it to run locally via `remote.extensionKind`, so it keeps talking to the host engine even when this
folder is reopened in the container.

## Coding Agents

This Dev Container preinstalls the **Claude Code** and **Mistral Vibe** VS Code extensions (see
[`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json)); other agents (OpenAI Codex,
Cursor, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot) work too once you add them.

The rules every agent follows live in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md); that there is exactly one such file
is decided in [ADR-0001](docs/adr/0001-agent-governance-model.md). An agent that cannot read it
natively gets a pointer file instead. [`.claude/CLAUDE.md`](.claude/CLAUDE.md) is the one shipped
here; it carries the pointer and no rules of its own ([`AGENTS.md` §3](AGENTS.md#3-adr-rules)). It
exists for one gap only: Claude Code loads `CLAUDE.md`, not `AGENTS.md`, tracked upstream as
[anthropics/claude-code#34235](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/34235). Once that
lands, delete the pointer file rather than keeping a second file to maintain.

The procedures those rules name (proposing an ADR, planning a feature, reviewing a change,
revising the design) are Agent Skills under [`.agents/skills/`](.agents/skills/), the open format
and the directory Codex, Gemini CLI, and Cursor read
([ADR-0005](docs/adr/0005-procedures-as-skills.md)). An agent invokes one by name (`/review`) or
picks it up when the task matches its description. Claude Code reads `.claude/skills/` only, so
that directory holds one symlink per skill into `.agents/skills/`; a directory-level symlink is
not followed. The symlinks are pointers of the same kind as `CLAUDE.md`, tracked upstream as
[anthropics/claude-code#31005](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/31005). Delete them
when that lands, and add one for every skill added meanwhile; the documentation check fails on a
skill without its pointer. A rule is enforced only by what every agent hits: the git hooks under
[`.githooks/`](.githooks/), the checks, and the repository settings below. A tool's own
configuration is not used to enforce one, because a gate that one agent honours and the next does
not looks like a rule and is not one.

## Repository settings

Some of this project's rules cannot be enforced by files in the repository
([`AGENTS.md` §6](AGENTS.md#6-project-rules)). They are settings on the GitHub repository itself,
configured once by a maintainer and worth re-checking after a repository move or transfer:

- a **ruleset on `main`** that requires pull requests, requires the
  <!-- required-checks begin — compared with the workflow's jobs by scripts/check-docs.sh -->
  `docs`, `traceability`, `devcontainer`, and `shell`
  <!-- required-checks end -->
  jobs of the **Checks** workflow as required status checks (rulesets list checks by their job
  name), and blocks force pushes and branch deletion;
- enable **require a review from Code Owners** on that ruleset, so the two artifacts only a human
  decides, [`docs/SPECIFICATION.md`](docs/SPECIFICATION.md) and everything under
  [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) ([`AGENTS.md` §3](AGENTS.md#3-adr-rules)), cannot be merged without the
  owner named in [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS), which has to carry a real handle or
  team for the requirement to mean anything;
- enable **secret scanning with push protection**, the only mechanical backstop behind the secrets
  rule ([`AGENTS.md` §7](AGENTS.md#7-secrets)), which is otherwise carried by review alone;
- enable **private vulnerability reporting** (see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)).
